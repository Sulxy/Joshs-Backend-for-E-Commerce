# Joshs-Backend-for-E-Commerce

## Description
This is an application designed to use Insomnia. In this case, it creates and seeds a sample database which can then be altered using RESTful CRUD operations. The database holds some basic information required to sell anyting online, and allows for information to be retrieved, updated, created, or deleted.

## Installation
Clone this repository like you would any other, and install the dependencies outlined as instructed at the beginning of this video (dotenv, express, mysql2, sequelize, and nodemon).

## Usage
Once you have the repository cloned and the dependencies installed: Open your command line, navigate to the correct folder (the one that contains server.js), and type "node server.js". When this command is run, you should see "App listening on Port 3001!" appear in your terminal. From here, we will be using Insomnia, as you will see in the video.
